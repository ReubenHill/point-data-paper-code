### Instructions for installing ROL

You'll need `patchelf` and boost, both of which should be available from your package manager of choice.
Then execute the following:

```
pip3 install roltrilinos==0.0.9
pip3 install ROL==0.0.16
```

The documentation for [Fireshape](https://fireshape.readthedocs.io) has a nice [description](https://fireshape.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ROL.html) of ROL and some of the options you can pass to the solver.
